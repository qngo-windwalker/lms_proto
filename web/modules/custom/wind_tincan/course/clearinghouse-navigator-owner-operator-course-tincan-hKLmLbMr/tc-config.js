  "en-US": "&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Clearinghouse Navigator&amp;rsquo;s Owner-Operator Training Module. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration&amp;rsquo;s drug and alcohol Clearinghouse is an important new safety rule being implemented to prevent commercial drivers who have violated DOT drug and alcohol testing rules from avoiding the consequences of that violation by applying for safety-sensitive work with a new employer without disclosing the prior violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this module, you will learn about DOT drug and alcohol testing rules and their associated requirements; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration&amp;#39;s new drug and alcohol Clearinghouse requirement, effective in January, 2020; your role and your responsibilities as an owner-operator covered by this new requirement; how and when to perform Clearinghouse queries; when you must use a TPA to stay compliant with the Clearinghouse rule; how to register to gain access to the Clearinghouse; how to correct information erroneously reported to the Clearinghouse; and general administrative requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, let&amp;rsquo;s make sure you are taking the correct course. If you happen to be an owner-operator who also employs other drivers, we recommend you take Clearinghouse Navigator&amp;rsquo;s Employer Training Module instead of this one. If you are an owner-operator who employs only yourself and who does not have any other employees, Clearinghouse Navigator&amp;rsquo;s Owner-Operator Training Module is the right choice and you should proceed with this course.&lt;/p&gt;"

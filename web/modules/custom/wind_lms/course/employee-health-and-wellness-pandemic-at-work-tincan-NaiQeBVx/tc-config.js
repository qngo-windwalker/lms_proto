As an employee who performs essential functions, and must continue to work outside your home, you are on the frontlines of the pandemic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of your exposure to the general public, you must understand how to protect yourself, those around you, and implement practices to reduce the spread of the virus.
